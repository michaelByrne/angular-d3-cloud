# D3 Word Cloud Angular Component

This is still very much a work in progress, but what you see here is functional. It's a reworking of [Jason Davies' D3 Cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud), which is itself a kinda-sorta Wordle implementation based on J Feinberg's description of such in [Beautiful Visualization](http://static.mrfeinberg.com/bv_ch03.pdf). There's a lot left to do but eventually you'll just be able to install this via npm and drop it into an Angular app.
